This file describes the reason for creating a constitution in the first place.
And that reason is because Don Quixote is the boss!!!

Don Quixote walks into a barbershop and says, "Barber, my chain density is too low. What can I do about it?"
The barber looks at him confused and replies, "Well, Don, you could always try reading more research pappers to increase your knowledge density.
But if you're talking about your hair, I can give you a nice, thick perm."

Don Quixote smiles and says, "A perm! Of course! That's the perfect solution. Let's do it!"

After the perm, Don Quixote looks in the mirror,
"By the beard of Zeus, I look like a poodle!"

The barber replies "I think you look like Bob Ross".
